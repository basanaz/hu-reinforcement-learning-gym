Specifically, the [CartPole-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/) and [MountainCar-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/) environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will try to create a table containing the expected reward for each combination of a *state* and *action*. We will use this table to choose the (hopefully) best action given the state the system is in.\n",

        "## Runtime and environment\n",
        "This [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) was made to run on Google Colab. For this training, we recommend using the Google Colab environment.\n",

It behaves similar to Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Hub and Jupyter Lab, so if you have any experience with those, you're good to go!\n",
        "\n",
        "Some notes on Google Colab:\n",
        "- **Processes in Google Colab won't run forever**. These may be terminated at any time when the platform is crowded, and *will definitely* terminate after 12 hours. To maintain persistency, you can attach the session to **Google Drive** and have your models persist themselves to the Google Drive periodically.\n",
        "- You can enable GPU or TPU support! You can find this option under *Runtime* -> *Change runtime type*.\n",
        "- After installing dependencies, you need to restart the runtime in order to actually use them.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want to run the code on your own platform or system, you need to keep a few things in mind:\n",
        "- The dependencies you need to install may differ from the ones we installed here. The installed dependencies are suitable for Google Colab, Ubuntu, and Debian.\n",
        "- Since Google Colab isn't attached to a monitor, we render the output to a video file. On your own machine the built-in render method from OpenAI's Gym may suffice.\n",
